# Monitoring Vault with Prometheus

A Vault node exposes [telemetry][telemetry] information that can be used to monitor and alert on the health and performance of a Vault cluster.

## How the Vault Metrics are Exposed

By default the Vault operator will configure each vault pod to publish [statsd][statsd] metrics.

The Vault operator runs a [statsd-exporter][statsd-exporter] container inside each Vault pod to convert and expose those metrics in the format for Prometheus.

`curl` the `/metrics` endpoint on port `9102` for any vault pod to get the Prometheus metrics:

```sh
$ VPOD=$(kubectl -n default get vault example -o jsonpath='{.status.vaultStatus.active}')
$ kubectl -n default exec -ti ${VPOD} --container=vault -- curl localhost:9102/metrics
# HELP vault_core_unseal Metric autogenerated by statsd_exporter.
# TYPE vault_core_unseal summary
vault_core_unseal{quantile="0.5"} NaN
vault_core_unseal{quantile="0.9"} NaN
vault_core_unseal{quantile="0.99"} NaN
vault_core_unseal_sum 2.077112
vault_core_unseal_count 1
. . .
```

## Consuming the Metrics

The Vault operator also creates a service with the same name as the Vault cluster that exposes the `/metrics` endpoint for the Vault nodes via the `prometheus` port. So for a Vault cluster named `example` the following service exists:
```sh
$ kubectl -n default get service example -o yaml
```
```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: vault
    vault_cluster: example
  name: example
  namespace: default
  ...
spec:
  ports:
  - name: vault-client
    port: 8200
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8200
  - name: vault-cluster
    port: 8201
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8201
  - name: prometheus
    port: 9102
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 9102
  selector:
    app: vault
    vault_cluster: example
  type: ClusterIP
  ...
```

A `ServiceMonitor` with the following spec can be created to describe the above Vault service as target for Prometheus.

```YAML
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: vault
      vault_cluster: example
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      - default
  endpoints:
    - interval: 30s
      path: /metrics
      port: prometheus
```

Consult the [tectonic application monitoring][application-monitoring] and [Prometheus operator][prometheus-operator] docs on how to setup and configure Prometheus with a `ServiceMonitor` to consume the metrics for a target service.

## Alerting Rules

The following alert rules for some key metrics are provided as a guide for the best practice of alerting on Vault metrics.

- [`vault_core_leadership_lost_count`](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/telemetry.html#vault-core-leadership_lost)
- [`vault_core_step_down_count`](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/telemetry.html#vault-core-step_down)
- [`vault_core_leadership_setup_failed`](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/telemetry.html#vault-core-leadership_setup_failed)

The sample alert rules assume Prometheus is configured to monitor a Vault service named `example`.

```YAML
alert: VaultLeadershipLoss
expr: sum(increase(vault_core_leadership_lost_count{job="example"}[1h])) > 5
for: 1m
labels:
 severity: critical
annotations:
 summary: High frequency of Vault leadership losses
 description: There have been more than 5 Vault leadership losses in the past 1h
```

```YAML
alert: VaultLeadershipStepDowns
expr: sum(increase(vault_core_step_down_count{job="example"}[1h])) > 5
for: 1m
labels:
 severity: critical
annotations:
 summary: High frequency of Vault leadership step downs
 description: There have been more than 5 Vault leadership step downs in the past 1h
```

```YAML
alert: VaultLeadershipSetupFailures
expr: sum(increase(vault_core_leadership_setup_failed{job="example"}[1h])) > 5
for: 1m
labels:
 severity: critical
annotations:
 summary: High frequency of Vault leadership setup failures
 description: There have been more than 5 Vault leadership setup failures in the past 1h
```

The above queries and parameters of the alert rules should be tuned for your particular use case. Read more on [Prometheus queries][prometheus-queries] and [alerting rules][alerting-rules] to learn how to write the alerting rules as needed.
