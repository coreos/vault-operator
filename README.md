# Vault Operator

An operator to create and manage Vault instances for Kubernetes clusters on Tectonic. Vault instances created by the Vault operator are highly available and support automatic failover and upgrade.

An example namespace, `vault-services`, is used in this document.

## Prerequisites

* [Tectonic 1.7+](https://coreos.com/tectonic) is installed
* `kubectl` is installed

## Getting Started

Verify `kubectl` is configured to use a 1.7+ Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
$ kubectl version | grep "Server Version"
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"7", GitVersion:"v1.7.1+coreos.0", GitCommit:"fdd5383472eb43e60d2222503f03c76445e49899", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2017-07-18T19:44:47Z", GoVersion:"go1.8.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

### Creating a namespace

Create the namespace `vault-services`:

```
kubectl create namespace vault-services
```

### Configuring RBAC

By default, the Vault operator has no privilege to access any resources in Tectonic. Configure RBAC rules to grant access to the Vault operator.

1. Generate a RBAC yaml file from the template given in the repository:

    ```sh
    sed 's/{KUBE_NS}/vault-services/g' example/rbac-template.yaml > example/rbac.yaml
    ```

2. Create the RBAC role:

    ```sh
    kubectl -n vault-services create -f example/rbac.yaml
    ```

    The RBAC rule grants `admin` role to the service account in the `vault-services` namespace.


### Deploying the etcd operator

The Vault operator employs etcd operator to deploy an etcd cluster as the storage backend. There is no etcd operator installed by default.
Deploy one into the `vault-services` namespace:

```sh
kubectl -n vault-services create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/etcd-operator/master/example/deployment.yaml
```

### Deploying the Vault operator

Vault operator image is private. Use "quay.io" pull secret to get the image.

1. Create pull secret from the existing `coreos-pull-secret`:

    ```
    kubectl get secrets -n tectonic-system -o yaml coreos-pull-secret | sed 's/tectonic-system/vault-services/g' | kubectl create -f -
    ```

2. Deploy the Vault operator:

    ```
    kubectl -n vault-services create -f example/deployment.yaml
    ```

    Wait for 10s until the Vault operator is up and running.

3. Verify that the operators are running:    

      ```
      $ kubectl -n vault-services get deploy
      NAME             DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
      etcd-operator    1         1         1            1           1d
      vault-operator   1         1         1            0           6s
      ```


### Deploying Vault

#### Configuring TLS secrets

In this example, the Vault operator configures a default TLS setup for all the Vault pods in the cluster. For an overview of the default TLS configuration or how to specify specify custom TLS assets see the [TLS setup guide](doc/user/tls_setup.md).

#### Submitting Vault Custom Resource

1. Create a Vault custom resource:

    ```
    kubectl -n vault-services create -f example/example_vault.yaml
    ```

    Wait for around 20s.

2. Ensure that `example-vault-...` pod is up:

    ```
    $ kubectl -n vault-services get pods
    NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    etcd-operator-809151189-1j7jl    1/1       Running   0          2d
    example-vault-613074584-5lwbg    0/1       Running   0          49s
    example-vault-etcd-0000          1/1       Running   0          1m
    example-vault-etcd-0001          1/1       Running   0          1m
    example-vault-etcd-0002          1/1       Running   0          1m
    vault-operator-146442885-gj98d   1/1       Running   0          1m
    ```

3. Print the Vault pods:

    ```
    $ kubectl -n vault-services get pods -l app=vault,name=example-vault
    NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    example-vault-613074584-5lwbg   0/1       Running   0          8m
    ```

4. Verify that the Vault nodes can be viewed in the "vault" resource status:

      ```
      $ kubectl -n vault-services get vault example-vault -o jsonpath='{.status.sealedNodes}'
      [example-vault-994933690-5v7c1]
      ```

      Vault is unready because it is uninitialized and sealed.

For information on using the deployed Vault, see [vault.md](./doc/user/vault.md) .


### Uninstalling Vault operator

1. Delete the Vault resource and configuration:

    ```
    kubectl -n vault-services delete -f example/example_vault.yaml
    ```

2. Wait for around 20s to make sure etcd and Vault pods are deleted.

3. Delete operators and other resources:

    ```
    kubectl -n vault-services delete deploy vault-operator etcd-operator
    kubectl -n vault-services delete secret coreos-pull-secret
    kubectl -n vault-services delete -f example/rbac.yaml
    ```
